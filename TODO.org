* TODO A better CSS style would be great
** TODO Menu should be visible at the top at all times
See for instance http://www.ieee-security.org/TC/EuroSP2017/index.php
** TODO Nicer font
For instance http://www.ieee-security.org/TC/EuroSP2017/index.php
* TODO Make navigation easier (solvable by CSS too?)
- The only part that gets in the way is the subsections of the Open
  Positions part, but maybe those can initially be "folded away" and
  only shown if the viewer clicks?
- Otherwise consider splitting the main page into 4 separate pages?
* TODO A nice SECOMP logo would be nice
* TODO A similar website for the Micro-Policies project would be nice
