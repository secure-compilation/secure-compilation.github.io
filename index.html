            <h1>Efficient Formally Secure Compilers to a Tagged Architecture</h1>

            <p><strong>SECOMP</strong> is a new research project aimed at building the first efficient formally secure compilers for realistic programming languages (see <a href="#project">project description</a> below). The project is generously funded for 5 years (roughly between 2017 and 2021) by an <a href="https://erc.europa.eu/funding-and-grants/funding-schemes/starting-grants">ERC Starting Grant</a>. Over the duration of the project we are looking to hire several excellent students and young researchers to work under the supervision of <a href="http://prosecco.gforge.inria.fr/personal/hritcu/">Cătălin Hriţcu</a> at <a href="https://www.inria.fr/en/centre/paris">Inria Paris</a> (see <a href="#positions">open positions</a> below). We also have funding for sabbaticals and short-term visits to Paris for researchers with an interest in secure compilation.</p>
<h1 id="positions">Open Positions</h1>
<p>We are looking for excellent, highly motivated students and young researchers for <a href="#intern">Research Internship</a>, <a href="#phd">PhD Student</a>, <a href="#postdoc">PostDoc</a>, <a href="#postdoc">Starting Researcher</a>, and <a href="#engineer">Research Engineer</a> positions at <a href="https://www.inria.fr/en/centre/paris">Inria Paris</a>, under the supervision of <a href="http://prosecco.gforge.inria.fr/personal/hritcu/">Cătălin Hriţcu</a>. We can additionally support exceptional candidates for permanent <a href="#cr">Researcher</a> positions funded and awarded competitively by Inria. More details about each of these follow.</p>
<h2 id="intern">Research Internships</h2>
<p>The research internships are for excellent students at the BSc and MSc levels interested in getting an initial contact with research and for PhD students at other institutions who are interested in getting hands on experience with research on the SECOMP project. Successful internships normally result in a research publication at a good international conference, and most often the BSc and MSc students we advise <a href="http://prosecco.gforge.inria.fr/personal/hritcu/students.html">continue with a PhD</a>. Research internships at Inria are very flexible: they usually take between 3 and 6 months and can happen any time of the year, not just in the summer.</p>
<p>We are especially interested in interns with previous exposure or strong desire to learn:</p>
<ul>
<li>functional programming (e.g., ML or Haskell);</li>
<li>compilation (for imperative or functional languages);</li>
<li>formal security (e.g. full abstraction, noninterference, and other security properties);</li>
<li>formal verification, especially in a proof assistant like Coq (or <a href="https://www.fstar-lang.org/">F*</a>);</li>
<li>building secure systems</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="phd">PhD Student Positions</h2>
<p>We are seeking exceptional PhD candidates with a strong theoretical background and eager to strike a balance between solving deep foundational problems and achieving a practical impact by building innovative security and verification tools. We are particularly looking for candidates with some prior exposure to state-of-the-art research in</p>
<ul>
<li>programming languages in general and functional programming in particular;</li>
<li>formal verification in a proof assistant like Coq and verified compilation in particular</li>
<li>formal security (e.g. full abstraction, noninterference, and other security properties);</li>
<li>building secure systems</li>
</ul>
<p>In France, an MSc degree or equivalent is strictly required for pursuing a PhD. A PhD typically takes 3 years, and involves very little to no course-work, so a strong theoretical background and previous exposure to research are <em>pre-requisites</em> for a successful PhD. We thus strongly encourage prospective PhD students without a strong research background to follow at least the 2nd year of the <a href="https://wikimpri.dptinfo.ens-cachan.fr/doku.php">MPRI</a> programme, an intensive, research-oriented MSc programme in computer science taught by some of the best researchers in Paris. The 2nd year in the <a href="https://wikimpri.dptinfo.ens-cachan.fr/doku.php">MPRI</a> ends with a 4.5 month <a href="https://wikimpri.dptinfo.ens-cachan.fr/doku.php?id=stages">research internship</a>, and, as mentioned above, SECOMP is also looking for good interns.</p>
<p>Inria PhD students are <a href="https://www.inria.fr/en/institute/recruitment/offers/phd/faq#section4">payed a gross salary</a> of €1958 per month for their first and second year and €2059 per month for their third year. For more information about doing a PhDs at Inria please consult <a href="http://gallium.inria.fr/~xleroy/these.html">Xavier Leroy’s post on the topic</a> or the <a href="https://www.inria.fr/en/institute/recruitment/offers/phd/faq">official Inria FAQ</a>.</p>
<h2 id="postdoc">PostDoc and Starting Researcher Positions</h2>
<p>For the PostDoc (2+ year contract) and Starting Researcher (3+ year contract) positions we are seeking exceptional candidates with a strong, internationally competitive track record of research in programming languages, formal verification, or security. Particularly interesting research areas are:</p>
<ul>
<li>formal verification in a proof assistant like Coq and verified compilation in particular</li>
<li>formal security (e.g. full abstraction, noninterference, and other security properties);</li>
<li>building secure systems</li>
</ul>
<p>PostDocs and Starting Researchers can propose and follow their own research agenda in secure compilation and be fairly independent. They are expected to work collaboratively and co-advise interns and PhD students.</p>
<h2 id="engineer">Research Engineer Positions</h2>
<p>Are you an amazing hacker with an interest in state-of-the-art security and verification tools? Are you experienced at programming in C and/or ML and/or Haskell? Have you worked on a compiler before? Can you envision hacking in Coq or <a href="https://www.fstar-lang.org/">F*</a>? If you answered yes to some of these questions a Research Engineer position on SECOMP could be well-suited for you.</p>
<h2 id="cr">Support for Permanent Researcher Positions at Inria</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.inria.fr/en/institute/recruitment/offers/young-graduate-scientist/competitive-selection-cr2">Researcher positions at Inria</a> are permanent and are awarded via an extremely competitive contest, and each Inria team can realistically support <strong>at most one</strong> candidate each year in this competition. If you are an exceptional candidate interested in working in the <a href="http://prosecco.gforge.inria.fr/">Prosecco</a> team, the right time to get in touch with us is before the end of December. Working in <a href="http://prosecco.gforge.inria.fr/">Prosecco</a> as a PostDoc or Starting Researcher can help in obtaining our support for a permanent position.</p>
<h2 id="flexible-starting-dates-but-long-hiring-process">Flexible Starting Dates, but Long Hiring Process</h2>
<p>The non-permanent positions above can be filled over several years, so the starting dates are very flexible. Please be advised though that the hiring process at Inria Paris normally takes 2-3 months, irrespective of the level at which you apply (including internships!). Getting in touch with us early enough would thus be much appreciated.</p>
<h2 id="pardon-my-french">Pardon My French</h2>
<p>The language of communication in the SECOMP project is <strong>English</strong> and normally one can get along just fine in Paris with only a minimal level of French. Inria Paris provides free French courses to interested students and researchers.</p>

<h1 id="project">SECOMP Project</h1>
<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>Severe low-level vulnerabilities abound in today’s computer systems, allowing cyber-attackers to remotely gain full control. This happens in big part because our programming languages, compilers, and architectures were designed in an era of scarce hardware resources and too often trade off security for efficiency. The semantics of mainstream low-level languages like C is inherently insecure, and even for safer languages, establishing security with respect to a high-level semantics does not guarantee the absence of low-level attacks. Secure compilation using the coarse-grained protection mechanisms provided by mainstream hardware architectures would be too inefficient for most practical scenarios.</p>
<p>This project is aimed at leveraging emerging hardware capabilities for fine-grained protection to build the first, efficient secure compilers for realistic programming languages, both low-level (the C language) and high-level (ML and a dependently-typed variant). These compilers will provide a secure semantics for all programs and will ensure that high-level abstractions cannot be violated even when interacting with untrusted low-level code. To achieve this level of security without sacrificing efficiency, our secure compilers will target a tagged architecture, which associates a metadata tag to each word and efficiently propagates and checks tags according to software-defined rules. We will experimentally evaluate and carefully optimize the efficiency of our secure compilers on realistic workloads and standard benchmark suites. We will use property-based testing and formal verification to provide high confidence that our compilers are indeed secure. Formally, we will construct machine-checked proofs of full abstraction with respect to a secure high-level semantics. This strong property complements compiler correctness and ensures that no machine-code attacker can do more harm to securely compiled components than a component in the secure source language already could.</p>

<li><p><strong>Micro-Policies</strong> is an ongoing project aimed at showing how a rich set of <em>micro-policies</em> – instruction-level security monitoring mechanisms based on fine-grained metadata tags – can be described as instances of a common dynamic monitoring framework, formalized and reasoned about with unified verification tools, and efficiently implemented using programmable metadata-propagation hardware. This project is a collaboration between <a href="https://www.inria.fr/en/centre/paris">Inria Paris</a>, <a href="https://www.cis.upenn.edu/">University of Pennsylvania</a>, <a href="https://www.csail.mit.edu/">MIT</a>, <a href="http://www.pdx.edu/computer-science/">Portland State University</a>, and <a href="http://www.draper.com/">Draper Labs</a> (who have built <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5dIS1kDars">a RISC-V processor extended with support for micro-policies</a>). Micro-policies will be the main enabler for <em>efficient</em> secure compilation in SECOMP.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://www.crash-safe.org/">CRASH/SAFE</a></strong> was a DARPA-funded project (2011-2014) that has undertaken the clean-slate co-design of a secure network host including novel hardware, operating system, programming language, and the systematic testing and verification of key components.
